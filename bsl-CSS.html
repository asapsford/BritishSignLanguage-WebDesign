    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Sign language is a language that uses manual communication to convey meaning. 
        This can include the use of gestures, movement, orientation of the fingers, 
        arms or body and facial expressions. Sign languages are mainly used by the deaf 
        and hard of hearing but are also used by hearing individuals. For example, 
        those unable to physically speak, or those who have trouble speaking.

<p>One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC. Specifically, 
    in Plato's <em>Cratylus</em>, Socrates states: <em>"If we hadn't a voice or tongue, and wanted to express things to 
    one another, wouldn't	we try to make signs by moving our hands, head and the rest of our body, just 
    as dumb people do at present?"</em></p>

        <p>Until the 19th Century, most of our knowledge of historical sign languages has been limited to manual alphabets 
            such as fingerspelling (or <b>dactylogy</b>), which is the representation of the letters (and numbers) of the writing 
            systems using only the hands, rather than on the documentation of sign languages.</p>

            <p>Many sign languages have developed independently throughout the world, and with little documentation no first sign language 
                can be identified. However, the most recorded instances of sign languages seem to occur in Europe, during the 17th Century.</p>

                <p>n 1680, George Delgarno published his own method of deaf education in <em>Didascalocophus</em>, aka,  <em>The deaf 
                    and dumb mans tutor</em>. This publication included an "arthrological" alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing 
                    to different joints of the fingers and palms. The vowels of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used 
                    in <a href="#britishsignlanguage">British Sign Language</a>, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language (BANZL).</p>
